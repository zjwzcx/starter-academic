I’m a junior undergraduate student at the Dept. of Control Science & Engineering in Zhejiang University.

 I’ve been advised by professor Chunhui Zhao at State Key Laboratory of Industrial Control, Zhejiang University, where I focus on extracting features from industrial time series with deep neural networks. 



-------------Unmodified-------------

I further extend my work in the field of disentangled representation learning during my remote intern with Ph.D. Shao Huajie from CS@UIUC. Now I’m working on a NIPS challenge related to autonomous driving with both time series analysis and representation learning.

I take an active part in Mathematical Modeling Competition. I received Finalist Prize (2% among 20,000+ teams) this year in Interdisciplinary Contest in Modeling (ICM).

I am applying for a Ph.D./MS program this fall. You may check in my [CV](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1eolZzPNGJS-zb31B2uaAC3GMhQCTY-Pv/view?usp=sharing) for further information.

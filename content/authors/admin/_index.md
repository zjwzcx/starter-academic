I’m Xiao Chen, currently a junior undergraduate at [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/). In my freshman year, I was elected to Advanced Honor Class of Engineering Education (40 among 4000+ students majoring in Science and Engineering, providing special courses and scientific research training) at Chu-Kochen Honors College.

 I’ve been advised by Prof. [Chunhui Zhao](https://person.zju.edu.cn/chhzhao/)  since July 2020 at State Key Laboratory of Industrial Control Technology, Zhejiang University, where I focus on **Pattern Recognition**, **Representation Learning** and **Multi-modal Information Fusion** with Signal Processing and Machine Learning methods like PCA, SFA and Deep Neural Networks. Our tasks include data-driven modeling, like Soft-sensing, Fault Diagnosis and Root Cause Inference, etc.

{{< icon name="download" pack="fas" >}} **I am applying for a Ph.D./M.Phil. program (Fall 2022). You may check my [CV](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11MZ2fCa-A4rLXNCvlNYoBbG2FnX7fjyx/view?usp=sharing) for further information.**

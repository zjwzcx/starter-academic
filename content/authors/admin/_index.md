I’m Xiao Chen, currently a senior undergraduate at [**Zhejiang University**](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/). In my freshman year, I was elected to **Advanced Honor Class of Engineering Education** (40 among 4000+ students majoring in STEM fields, providing special courses and research training) at [**Chu Kochen Honors College**](http://ckc.zju.edu.cn/ckcen/main.htm).

 I’ve been advised by Prof. [**Chunhui Zhao**](https://person.zju.edu.cn/chhzhao/)  since July 2020 at State Key Laboratory of Industrial Control Technology, Zhejiang University, where I focus on **Representation Learning**, **Data-driven Modeling** and **Multi-sensor Information Fusion** with Signal Processing and Machine Learning methods like PCA and AutoEncoder. Our tasks include Soft-sensing, Fault Diagnosis and Root Cause Inference.

{{< icon name="download" pack="fas" >}} I am applying for a **Ph.D.** (Fall 2022). You may check my [**CV**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/18hl_m4j37ecp2RaXkDGbLFrIgXhoQyNo/view?usp=sharing) for further information.

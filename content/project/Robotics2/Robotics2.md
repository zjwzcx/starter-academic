- **Geometric Parameter Estimation:** A binocular camera is     used to record the dynamic position of the marker on the end-effector, and     the parameters are estimated by the plane arc constraint and the least     square method.
- **DH Table Correction:** The correction parameter Î² is used to correct the misalignment DH     table of parallel continuous joints, and the DH parameter is used for Inverse     Kinematics calculation.
- **Motion Control:** Interpolate     the joint angle sequence to achieve more stable and accurate Forward Kinematics     control
